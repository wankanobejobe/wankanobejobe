- Wankanobe with two turn tables and a microphone > Kickin' it at github and lovin' life for it. ;)

- There isn't a great feal that does not interest me but admittedly electronic gadgets has become a
  mainstay. The manipulation of hardware and coding that power our lives is a required part of my life
  so may as well keep abreast of wtf is going on, no? Yes? Maybe? haha
  
- Due to covid the norm here has been a little strained but a loner so nothing drastic has changed. 
  Getting back to work soon and this will aide in my mental well-being somewhat. I do not see school in my future
  anymore as almost in my mid fifties and actually looking to use my mind for a while instead of physical labor... 
  which is what I desire as it keeps me fit. My clas-room is here as well as every other source of "good"/workable 
  knowledge that is within reach and available.
  
- I just wanna hone skills related to devices and creating useful tools/assets that will make life less laborious 
  (say recovering a needed cell phone in a few minutes as opposed to an all day "thing"). Open to making aquaintences, 
  buddies and possibly even a coupla three friends. Self described "Anti-social-socialite" so commiting to intimate 
  relations do not come easily... although I can kick it and have fun without all the rulz, regs, policiez, procedurez, programz or protocolz. lol 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ...

wankanobejobe has gotta move on for a min but will update as we go, cool?

One love
